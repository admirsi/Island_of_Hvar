    <string name="app_name">Island of Hvar</string>
    <string name="description_text">
        Hvar is vaguely shaped like the profile of a holidaymaker reclining on a sun-lounger,
        which is altogether appropriate for the sunniest spot in the country (2724 sunny hours each year)
        and its most luxurious beach destination.\n\n
        Hvar Town offers swanky hotels, elegant restaurants and a general sense that, if you care about seeing and being seen,
        this is the place to be. Rubbing shoulders with the posh yachting are hundreds of young party goers,
        dancing on tables at the town\'s legendary beach bars. The northern coastal towns of Stari Grad and Jelsa
        are far more subdued and low-key.\n\n
        Hvar\'s interior hides abandoned ancient hamlets, craggy peaks, vineyards and the lavender fields that the island is famous for.
        This region is worth exploring on a day trip, as is the island\'s southern coast,
        which has some of Hvar most beautiful and isolated coves.\n
        The fabulous Hvar needs little introduction for anyone aware of the beautiful Croatian coastline.
        The sunniest island in Europe attracts thousands of boaters, party-goers, and nature lovers every year.
        It is an absolute must on anyone\'s Croatia itinerary. If you\'re only spending 24 hours in Hvar, make sure
        to follow this itinerary to get the best out of your Hvar experience.
